## Introduction

The Weather App is designed to provide users with accurate weather data in a user-friendly interface. Users can search for any city and get the current weather, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Material-UI**: A popular React UI framework for faster and easier web development.
- **JavaScript**: The programming language used for writing application logic.
- **Axios**: For making HTTP requests to the weather API.
- **OpenWeatherMap API**: A service that provides weather data.

## Usage

1. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. You should see the Weather App interface.

3. Enter a city name in the search bar and press "Enter" or click the search button to retrieve the weather data.

## Development

During development, you can use the following command to start the local server and watch for changes:

```bash
npm start
```

This command runs the app in development mode. The page will automatically reload if you make edits.
